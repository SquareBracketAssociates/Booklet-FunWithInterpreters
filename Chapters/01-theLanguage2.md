## Interpreting Pharo

We are going to write a programming language interpreter. And this raises the questions: what language are we going to interpret?
A language that is too complex would take ages to implement, the book would be too long.
Think of implementing any programming language you know: how many features does it have?
Complex languages have a lot of accidental complexity (think C, C++, Java).

In this book we have made a choice: Pharo itself. 
Pharo is small enough to be implementable in a couple of afternoons.
And it is large enough to be interesting, as we will show you next.
